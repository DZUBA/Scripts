# Scripts
Good day!
My name Alex Dzyubenko. I'm Senior System Administaror in Wargaming.net

Here is part of Shell scripts that I've created to make my life easier.
In near future I'll create/rewrite my scripts into Python.
Currently I study Python in University of Michigan via Coursera. And I've already get few certificates from Rice University.

Hope my scripts will help You!
